- **Automated Top-N Selection** based on composite scores

#### ?? Multi-Strategy Portfolio Manager
- **Portfolio Allocation System** supporting multiple strategies simultaneously
- **Strategy Categorization**:
  - Conservative (45%): High Sharpe (>2.0), Low DD (<10%), Low Vol (<15%)
  - Balanced (40%): Optimal risk/reward profile
  - Aggressive (15%): High returns, higher volatility
- **Dynamic Rebalancing** with configurable drift threshold
- **Per-Strategy Performance Tracking**:
  - Individual PnL and win rates
  - Drawdown monitoring
  - Trade count and metrics
- **Risk Management** with strategy-level kill switches

- **Reduced volatility penalty** from 15% to 10% (less aggressive penalization)
- **Reduced drawdown penalty** from 5% to 3% (balanced scoring)

- **Adjusted win rate component** from 10% to 8%

#### ?? Configuration

- Both test suites include:
  - Component isolation testing
  - Integration testing
  - Performance metrics validation
  - Edge case handling
